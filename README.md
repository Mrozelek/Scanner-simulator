## General info
Program works on linux based systems (checked for Debian distro). Server and client has to be used on the same system as far.  
You will be notified with available commands after the program's execution. Defaultly there are 3 terminals (TER1, TER2, TER3),
10 new workers without work time and they are assigned to 10 cards.  
Program's main role is to count a work time of every worker who have to use the rfid card on enter and exit.

## Technologies
* Python 3
* Mosquitto

## Setup
To execute client and server you will need to download *python* and *mosquitto* packages. Then enable mosquitto process.  
To start server you can use *python Server.py* command in *Server/* directory.  
To start client (terminal) you can use *python Client.py* command in *Client/* directory.

## Code examples
`2`  
`CARD2`  
\> Card read successfully  
`2`  
`CARD2`  
\> Your work time: 0:0.57

## Features
List of features ready:
* Read card (includes adding new card, changing worker state and printing worker's time)
* Delete or add terminal, card or worker
* Print list of terminals, cards or workers
* Assign or unassign card and reader
* Shutdown server remotely
* Shutdown terminal
* Writing and reading server backup on start and shutdown, based on *.txt files
* Writing all of activities done on server to *logs.txt* file

To-do list:
* Signing in session of terminal
* Encryption and decryption of session information
* Permission to administrative functions for authenticated sessions
* User can change ip on which mqtt works
* Switch from CUI to GUI (Tkinter)
* Switch from data in files to database (SQLite)

## Changelog
- Split project from one console where client and server was to use MQTT in several consoles (Server and multiple terminals).  
Client's methods hasn't been changed.  
Terminal's class has been deleted from server's database and moved as another solution.
